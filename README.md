# Production-Grade AWS Cloud Platform

### **DevOps • SRE • Cloud**

##  Overview

This project demonstrates the **design, deployment, and operation of a production-grade cloud-native platform on AWS**, following **DevOps, SRE, and DevSecOps best practices**.

The platform is built using **Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes (EKS), Helm, Ansible, GitHub Actions, and ArgoCD**, with a strong focus on **reliability, security, scalability, and observability**.

This project simulates **real-world production operations**, not a demo environment.

##  Goals

* Provision AWS infrastructure using **Infrastructure as Code**
* Deploy and operate a **highly available EKS cluster**
* Apply **SRE principles** (SLOs, SLIs, error budgets)
* Implement **secure CI/CD pipelines (DevSecOps)**
* Use **GitOps** for deployment
* Validate resilience via **chaos engineering**
